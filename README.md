# 🏗️ Bridge Foundation Design Automation

## 📖 Project Overview
This project automates the design process for various bridge foundation components, including isolated footings, pile caps, piers, and well foundations. Using advanced Excel formulas and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), these tools allow users to input load and environmental parameters to generate a complete foundation design quickly and accurately. This automation reduces design time, minimizes calculation errors, and provides users with validated results for efficient decision-making in bridge construction projects.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create a reliable, efficient tool for automating the design of bridge foundations. Key goals include:
- 🧱 Providing foundation designs for different types (isolated footing, pile cap, pier, well foundation) based on user-input conditions.
- ⚙️ Automating design calculations using VBA macros to prevent human errors.
- 📈 Generating P-M interaction curves for piers in compliance with IRC and IS code standards.
- ✅ Validating Excel-based designs against SAP2000 models to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## 🌟 Features
- **Automated Calculations**: Enter load and environmental data to generate foundation designs without manual calculations.
- **P-M Interaction Curve Generation**: Automates generation of interaction curves for pier designs based on regulatory standards.
- **Validated Results**: Compares designs with SAP2000 outputs to verify accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Project thesis includes background, design methodology, validation studies, and explanations of each foundation type.
